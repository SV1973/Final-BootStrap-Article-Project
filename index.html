            <p class="col-sm-12">Every Big organization from Tech Companies to Governmental Bodies generate a large amount of valuable Data. Hence it is very important for them to keep it safe from unauthorized access and attacks.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">This is where the Cybersecurity comes in.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Cybersecurity is protection of computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software and electronic data, as well as from the disruption of the services they provide.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Since the no. of users and the devices are increasing, providing the cybersecurity to everyone is becoming more challenging than ever.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Leak of digital data can cause major threat to mankind. The most common forms of digital threat also known as Cyber Crimes are as follows :-</p>
            
            <ul class="col-sm-12">
                <li>Phishing</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="col-sm-12">After getting a look on above list that can take place due to lack of Cybersecurity, It is more wiser decision to accept that</p>
            
            <p class="quotes col-sm-12">Cyber secure is less of a technology and more of a responsibility.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Since the cyber attackers are getting more skilled and innovative, the companies are  increasing the security budget year by year to thrawt malacious threats.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12">Companies like IBM, Deloitte, Amazon, J.P.Morgan, Hackerone, Fireeye, Cisco, Blackberry, Avast, are apparently in search of good skilled Cybersecurity candidates.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-12">VR and AR is the use of Computer Technology to create a simulated environment.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-12">Instead of looking at a screen infront, users are immersed and can interact with 3D world by simulating asa many senses as possible such as vision, hearing, touch, the computer teleports the users to an artificial world.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-12">In the future AR can be used for transitioning from PC based to standalone mobile VR devices Mapping of real world to enable persistent AR mirror walls, eye tracking and facial expressions built in for natural communication.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-12">Augmented Reality overlays or ads digital on a life view often by using you camera on your smartphone. eg. you using snapchat filters on your live selfies or when you play game that is Pokemon Go.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">All the makeup and the crown appearing on your selfies or a pokemon appearing in front of you on the road you're walking on is nothing but the AR in action.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">The only difference between AR and VR is Ar simulates artificial objects in real world and VR creates a totally different artificial environment.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">VR CAGR percentage is 48.7, covering 40% of the market share.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Few companies operating in this field are Microsoft, Hawaii, Facebook, Google, Boston Consulting Group, MapSystems, innDataAnalytics and cognitive3D</p>

            <p class="col-sm-12">Blockchain offers security that is useful in many other ways. In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be described as data you can only add to, not take away from or change.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Hence the term “chain” because you’re making a chain of data. Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Each transaction on a blockchain is encrypted with a digital signature that validates its authenticity. This makes the dta stored on the blockchain tamper-proof and secure.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">IT professionals are already working on blockchain to provide a secure underlying infrastructure to many aspects of out digital life</p>

            <p class="col-sm-12">I'd like to give a suggestion over this.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Many of the readers usually judge the technologies by the rank the earned in the list.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">I want you to know that every technology has its own pros and cons and it is our duty to not judge any technology on any random basis. Every technology is good at its own place.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">So do not learn a technology according to the rank it holds or it'll look "cool". Learn a technology so that you can master it passionately and provide better solutions to the world in coming years.</p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">Learning and Mastering your preferred technology will not be an easy task. But it won't be a difficult task as well b'coz your <strong>Consistency, Dedication, and Perseverance</strong>  will surely pay off. </p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-12">As time passes I'll upload precisely detailed articles on each of the topics mentioned above.</p>
